# IOPT2AC
Prototype of a toolkit to generate executable code for distributed embedded controllers, based on the code generated by IOPT Tools, a cloud-based tool for model-driven development of controllers. The toolkit includes a tool to change the generated code to allow inter-device communication though the I2C-bus specification.

### Requirements
* Python 2.7 (with PyObjC, os, os.path and re libs)
* OSX machine
* 3 Arduino Boads
* 1 BreadBoard
* 8 LED's
* 2 4.7k Ohm Resistors (for I2C)
* 8 220 Ohm Resistors (for LED's)
* Hook-up wires

### IOPT-Tools

The [IOPT-Tools] framework allows the interactive creation of graphical models using IOPT nets. The user creates the Petri net graph and associates external signals and events to its transitions and places. Each event is defined based on the change of a signal value (edge up or edge down). The models can be interactively simulated [1] and its state space generated and verified to detect deadlocks, determine needed memory resources, and identify the occurrence of desirable global states [2]. The nodes can have distinct associated time domains. These models can be automatically split in the corresponding single time domain models from which code is then generated to be run in distinct processors [3], [4], [5]. In this prototype it is possible to run those nets on Arduino boards.

For more information on how to use IOPT-Tools framework please read it's [user manual].

For this paper a new account was created with the following credentials: user: "etfa2017"; pass: "etfa2017".

#### Model Creation
For proof of concept there were created two models, one with a single time domain (single controller needed) and another with two distinct time domains (three controllers needed).

With IOPT-Tools it is possible to open the models present on the [models folder] with the "Upload Model File" feature.
Since the user has the model opened the C language code can be generated with a click in "Generate C Code" button, as seen in the following figure.

![Generate C Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arturataide/IOPT2AC/master/images/etfa/generatecode.jpg)

This is the example for a single controller model, and the code generated is available [here].

For the N-time domain models an additional step needs to be completed. The user must generate the GALS Models (Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous) first with the "Decompose GALS" button. The framework will automatically generate N new models as the N is equal to the time domains present in the model.
With two time domains (proof of concept example) it will generate two models as seen in the following figure.

![GALS Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arturataide/IOPT2AC/master/images/etfa/split.jpg)

In order to obtain the C code the user has to access every GALS Model ad press the "Generate C Code" button.
This model code is present in [this folder] named as "3cars_async_TD-1.zip", "3cars_async_TD-5.zip" and "3cars_async_TD-6.zip".

#### Prepare the Arduino project
Please follow this steps to prepare the Arduino project:

##### Step1
With a machine with OSX download and execute the [tool] by executing the "main.app" file present in "dist" folder or with the following command in the terminal
```sh
$ ./dist/main.app/Contents/MacOS/main
```

##### Step2
Copy the GALS models .zip files into "zip_files" folder prensent in the IOPT2AC_tool folders

##### Step3:

Check if the models are detected automatically (see the image below). If not, please make sure that you've correctly copied the .zip files generated by the IOPTool into the "zip_files" folder and then click in "Verify models in path" button.

</p>
##### Step4
If the IOPT2AC_tool detects the correct number of models you are able to click in "Generate Arduino Files". As soon as the processes finishes the tool shows the models processed and their adresses.

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arturataide/IOPT2AC/master/images/etfa/done.jpg" width="400">
</p>

#### Step5
Burn the projects available in "zip_files" folder with Arduino IDE. Follow the next image to mount the correct architecture.

</p>

The user can see the models behaviour with the Serial Monitor at 9600 bitrate.

###### Single Controller
In order to use the single controller version please use the [IOPT2AC_single.py] script.
 Run the IOPT2AC script passing the input (`-i`) file and output (`-o`) file arguments.
 The input file must be the `net_io.c` file and the output file must have `.cpp` extension in other to fully support `Wire.h` [library]. After running the script please remove the `net_io.c` file.
 ```sh
 $ rm MakeFile http_server.* dummy_gpio.c linux_sys_gpio.c raspi_mmap_gpio.c net_server.*
 $ mv net_main.c <FOLDER_NAME>.ino
 $ python IOPT2AC_single.py -i net_io.c -o net_io.cpp
 Inputs
 Digital 2 -> net1
 Digital 3 -> net2
 2
 Outputs:
 Digital 4 -> led1
 Digital 5 -> led2
 2
 Input Events:
 []
 0
 Output Events:
 []
 0
 $ rm net_io.c
 ```

For any questions with the preparation and setup please contact arturjataide@gmail.com.
